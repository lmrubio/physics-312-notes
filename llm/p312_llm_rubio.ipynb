    "## General overview/ideas\n",
    "Before getting into the math and internal workings of a large language model, one of the readings in class looks at a specific example: ChatGPT, and how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT is an example of a **large language model** that functions like a chatbot. The post by Stephen Wolfram titled *\"What is ChatGPT doing ... and why does it work?\"* [@wolfram_2023] provides a basic picture of how LLMs (specifically ChatGPT) work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key ideas from the post.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) ChatGPT creates human-intelligible text by adding one probable “word” at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model chooses “probable words” based on data the model is trained on. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The most probable word is not necessarily what’s chosen (meaning there’s a random factor on choosing words — a “temperature” parameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) How are these probabilities calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The probabilities are not derived empirically from data (the amount of text available is huge), and when considering consecutive words, the number of possibilities increase even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Large language models attempt to estimate the probability of occurrence of sequences even without seeing explicitly all possible combinations of words in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter sections go over neural networks (large language models are neural networks):\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Neural networks \n",
    "\n",
    "* Neural networks are composed of a layer of nodes called neurons: these neurons correspond to a simple numerical function\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neurons have incoming inputs with associated weights, and the value of each neuron depends on the values of previously connected neurons and an applied “activation” function. Mathematically: \n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ f[w \\cdot x + b], x = \\{x_1, x_2, …\\} $$\n",
    "    $f$ is the form taken by the activation function, which generally introduces a non-linearity. $w$ are weights, $b$ are constants that are chosen per neuron (biases), and $x$ are the inputs to the neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weights of the neurons in the network are adjusted at each step until it learns the target function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A loss function (or a cost function) is computed to see “how far away\" from the model is from the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Minimizing the loss function - gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Considerations when training neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choosing neural net architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "* Getting/preparing the training data\n",
    "    - Instead of training from scratch: a) incorporate an already-trained neural net, b) use the neural net to generate more training examples\n",
    "* Determining the size of the neural network (depends on the perceived difficulty of the task)\n",
    "* Different choices for setting hyperparameters, loss functions, minimization of the loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "Since neural networks take in numbers as inputs, text should be represented to numbers. How do large language models take in its inputs?\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Representing texts as numbers: **embeddings**\n",
    "* A word embedding can be thought of as laying out words in a “meaning space”.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can extend this to expressing sequences of words as a collection of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In large language models, instead of words, the object of interest are tokens. Tokens can be less than a word (like a prefix, suffix, a sub-unit of a word).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the most relevant part, at least for the class, is the internal workings of large language models. In the text [@wolfram_2023], there is a section on what's inside ChatGPT.\n",
    "*  a GPT-3 network with 175 billion weights\n",
    "\n",
    "* the neural network architecture used is **“transformer”**\n",
    "\n",
    "* transformers have the notion of **“attention”**\n",
    "\n",
    "* embedding vectors for original tokens &rarr embedding vector goes through the layers of the neural network (feed-forward)\n",
    "\n",
    "* only specific neurons on different layers are connected (transformer architecture)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing these points, large language models are neural networks trained on large amounts of text, often resulting in models with millions to billions of parameters. Since neural networks take in numbers as input, words are converted into a numerical representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on key ideas mentioned here and some questions that pop up here.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What model architectures are used for LLMs?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are \"transformers\" and \"attention\" in the context of neural networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "* How are text represented to numbers in neural networks?"

    "## Neural networks\n",
    "For this section, we look at multiple readings in class: Carolin Penke's blog post titled \"A mathematician's introduction to transformers and large language models\" [@carolin_2022], the original transformer paper \"Attention is all you need!\" [@attention_2017] and the annotated version [@annotated_trans], and Christopher Olah's blog post on \"Understanding LSTM networks\" [@colah].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "Neural networks trained on huge amounts of text to generate intelligible sentences from input text is the usual approach to creating language models [@carolin_2022].\n",
    "Instead of training a neural network from scratch, it is common practice to use a pre-trained model which is trained further on a task-specific dataset (*fine-tuning* a model). Computing outputs from a trained model is referred to as *inference*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference for neural networks involve computing resources. Computational steps in neural networks can involve a series of matrix multiplications, and depending on the size of the model, may require systems with a lot of compute. The goal of training is for the model to learn the relationships of inputs to outputs in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural network architecture\n",
    "#### Feedforward neural network\n",
    "```{mermaid}\n",
    "%%| label: fig-nn\n",
    "%%| file: neural_net.mmd\n",
    "%%| fig-cap: \"Example of a feedforward neural network.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "A trained neural network takes in a vector representation of input data into an input layer. It passes through hidden layers before exiting the output layer. Moving through successive layers involves matrix multiplication of the vectors and applying an activation function. For the feedforward neural network architecture, there are no loops. The feedforward neural network is one of the most basic architectures developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recurrent neural network and LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "```{mermaid}\n",
    "%%| label: fig-rnn\n",
    "%%| file: RNN.mmd\n",
    "%%| fig-cap: \"Recurrent neural network.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurrent neural network allows loops in parts of the neural network. For the RNN shown in @fig-rnn, some chunk of neural network $A$ takes in $x$ as an input and outputs $h$, while allowing for information to be passed from one step of the network through the next using the loop. RNNs have been used for applications with sequential data, like text. However, most of the successful results using RNNs were made through LSTMs, a special kind of RNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Example of an unrolled RNN from C. Olah's blog [@colah].](RNN-longtermdependencies.png){width=60% #fig-dependence}\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest problems encountered by traditional RNNs are vanishing gradients. As mentioned in the overview, neural networks by updating its weights such that the loss/cost function is minimized. When the gradients vanish, the network barely updates its weights. In the example in [@colah], trying to predict the last word in the phrase \"I grew up in France... I speak fluent **French**.\" would be troublesome because of the \"long-term dependency\". Immediate information at the end suggests the name of a language completes the phrase, but the language in question needs the context of *France* to specify the language. In the diagram from the blog (@fig-dependence), it's possible for cases where the context is very far away ($x_1$ and $x_2$) from the output being predicted ($h_{t+1}$). In Carolin's post [@carolin_2022], this is described as older words having minimal influence on the gradients. \n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term short memory (LSTM) networks can learn long-term dependencies by introducing a cell state. Information can be removed or added to the cell states using gates. While the addition of gates helps with long-term dependencies, the sequential nature of RNNs and LSTMs constrains parallelization in training. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transformer architecture\n",
    "The transformer architecture is first showcased in the paper \"Attention is All You Need [@attention_2017]\". Before this work, attention mechanisms are often used to enhance RNNs. The transformer architecture relies mainly on attention mechanism to get relationships between input and output. In the \"Attention\" paper, the main task is machine translation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper, they describe the attention function as \"mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors\" [@attention_2017]. The attention function is computed simultaneously for all queries by matrix multiplication. The definition introduced in the paper is given by: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax \\left( \\dfrac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}} \\right) V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $softmax$ function converts the values into a probability distribution (which means they sum to 1). The transformer architecture utilizes parallel attention layers which they call multi-head attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of word embeddings is part of pre-training for models with the transformer architecture. These embeddings are used to convert input and output tokens to vectors.  To make use of the order of sequences without using recurrence or convolution, they added information on the position of a token in the sequence which they call \"positional encoding\". The positional encoding is added to the input embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformer architecture is widely used in large language models and has large success in various natural language processing applications."

    "## Tokens and embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we focus on tokenization and embeddings. Representing words into a numerical form is important for neural networks to be able to accept text as input. Tokenization often refers to breaking up raw text into tokens, and embeddings is used to represent words into a numerical vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenization\n",
    "In tokenization, raw text is converted to tokens. Tokens can be words, characters, or subwords (like prefixes, suffixes, etc.). spaCy [@spacy2] is a popular library for NLP applications, and has its own tokenizer. We will use it as an example to see what happens to text after tokenization."
