    "\n",
    "Hyperspectral cameras capture hyperspectral signals which can have mixed pixels due to the limited spatial resolution of the instrument. The signal measured at a pixel is a mixture of light scattered by materials in the scene within the pixel's equivalent spatial resolution. @fig-model shows an example of spectra for different pixels, both mixed and pure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal for hyperspectral unmixing is to separate pixel spectra to the spectral signatures of the materials in the pixel (endmembers) and their relative amounts (abundances).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hyperspectral imaging example. From Dalla Mura's slides [@dalla_mura]](dalla_mura.png){width=80% #fig-model}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixing models\n",
    "Unmixing algorithms depend on the type of mixing model assumed for the hyperspectral images. They are usually classified as either **linear** or **nonlinear**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* linear - Macroscopic pure components are distributed in patches within the field of view (or the pixel). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The measured spectra at a pixel is the weighted average of the individual spectra of the materials in the pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "* nonlinear - Microscopic pure components are intimately mixed within the pixel. Another possibility is when the scene has multiple layers, resulting in complex mechanisms for scattering light.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - This usually requires a priori knowlege on the materials in the scene.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Without a priori knowledge, the problem at hand can be referred to as blind/unsupervised hyperspectral unmixing (blind HU).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The goal is still to identify materials present in a scene (and their compositions) using high spectral resolution of hyperspectral images.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convex geometry concepts (discovered empirically) find a lot of usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "In the paper \"A Signal Processing Perspective on Hyperspectral Unmixing\" [@remote_sense], the focus is on linear mixing models. The notes that follow here are mainly from this paper and Dalla Mura's slides [@dalla_mura].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear mixing model\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear mixing model is relatively simplistic but is a very representative model, which is the focus of many blind HU developments.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the linear mixing model can fail for strongly non-linear systems, it is still considered to be acceptable for most real-world scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "With $y_m[n]$ being the hyperspectral measurement for a spectral band $m$ and pixel $n$: let $y[n] = [y_1[n], y_2[n],...,y_M[n]]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^M$ where M is the number of spectral bands. The linear mixing model can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y[n] = \\sum^N_{i = 1}a_i s_i[n] + v[n] = \\mathbf{A} s[n] + v[n] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $n = 1,...,L$ (meaning there are L pixels. $a_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^M$ is an endmember signature vector, which contains spectral components of a specific material in the scene. N is the number of endmembers (or materials) in the scene. $\\mathbf{A} = [a_1,...a_N] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M\\times N}$ is the endmember matrix. s_i[n] is the contribution of each material $i$ at pixel $n$, or the abundance vector. and $v[n]$ is the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other aspects regarding linear mixing model formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- M can be larged because of the fine spectral resolution of hyperspectral cameras\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mixing is a consequence of spatial resolution limits\n",
    "\n",
    "- $s_i[n]$ is normalized (**abundance sum constraint or sum-to-one constraint**)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abundances are non-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Endmember spectra cannot be negative (since reflectance cannot be negative)\n",
    "\n",
    "Complications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $y[n]$ are processed measurements. (raw measurements from the camera already go through processing steps)\n",
    "\n",
    "- For simplicity, endmembers are associated with materials (assumed purity)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Definition of endmembers can be subjective depending on the application.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Sum-to-one constraint is assumed to hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Recovering the abundance map of every material is the goal.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- If the endmember matrix $A$ is known (materials in the scene are known exactly), unmixing becomes a constrained least squares problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- Usually, $A$ is not fully known because in reality, all the materials in the scene are not known exactly. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The problem is formulated similarly to blind source separation in formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - BSS methods are not in any mainstream HU approaches because under the unit simplex constraint, for the feasible set of abundance vectors do not satisfy statistical independence assumption.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Endmember extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "In categorizing algorithms for endmember extraction, there are three situations that can be encountered [@dalla_mura]:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The data contains at least one pure pixel per endmember. (Pure pixel assumption)\n",
    "2) The data does not contain pure pixels but contains N - 1 spectral vectors on each facet. (Minimum volume simplex fit)\n",
    "3) For highly mixed data, there are no spectral vectors near the facets. Volume minimization fails here. (Statistical framework must be used)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pure pixel assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the pure pixel assumption, an endmember $i$ has a pure pixel for some index $l_i$ if $$s[l_i] = \\hat{e}_i$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{e}_i$ is a unit vector with a nonzero element only for the $i$th entry. Pure pixel assumption holds if every endmember has a pure pixel. [@remote_sense]\n",
    "\n",
    "In @fig-model, the pixel for water is a pure pixel because there are no other materials within.\n",
    "\n",

    "1) Successive projections algorithm (SPA)\n",

    "    - SPA finds all endmembers for the noiseless case and under PPA.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If endmembers are highly similar, SPA will have problems.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - likely similar to orthogonal subspace projection (OSP) in Dalla Mura's slides\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Vertex component analysis\n",
    "    - Similar to SPA (in employing successive nulling), but picks pure pixels differently.\n",

    "    - VCA iteratively projects data to a direction orthogonal to the subspace spanned by endmembers that have been found already\n",
    "    \n",

    "### Convex geometry    \n",
    "For the last two methods, we've noticed that it talks about maximizing a simplex volume. What does this mean in terms of hyperspectral signals? For the previous 2 algorithms and the other algorithms will be discussing, we will use the convex geometry of hyperspectral signals\n",

    "![Convex geometry of hyperspectral signals. From \"A Signal Processing Perspective on Hyperspectral Unmixing\" [@remote_sense]](convex_geom.png){width=80% #fig-conv}\n",
    "\n",
    "In @fig-conv, we see that for N = 3, the convex hull of the endmember signatures $a_i$ forms a triangle that encloses all $y[n]$ (or all the hyperspectra of the pixels). Convex geometry HU methods finds a set of vectors $\\hat{a_i}$ that creates a convex hull that closely matches the convex hull created by the true endmembers $a_i$ (affine set fitting problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods without the pure pixel assumption\n",
    "These methods generate virtual endmembers located at the simplex with minimum volume enclosing all observations if *pure signatures are not assumed to be present*. Thus, these algorithms are just different implementations of simplex volume minimization. \n",
